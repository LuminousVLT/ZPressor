## Introduction

In the realm of 3D graphics, performance is key. ZPressor aims to address common bottlenecks in data processing and rendering. By implementing advanced compression algorithms, we enhance the efficiency of feed-forward systems, ensuring that they can handle larger datasets without sacrificing quality. 

Whether you are developing games, simulations, or visualizations, ZPressor provides a robust solution for your compression needs. 

## Features

- **Bottleneck-Aware Compression**: Tailored algorithms that focus on critical performance areas.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying sizes of datasets efficiently.
- **Ease of Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick adoption into existing projects.
- **High-Quality Output**: Maintains visual fidelity while optimizing data throughput.

## Installation

To get started with ZPressor, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuminousVLT/ZPressor.git
cd ZPressor
```

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can find the specific requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

After installation, you can begin using ZPressor in your project. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement ZPressor in your code:

```python
from zpressor import ZPressor

# Initialize ZPressor
compressor = ZPressor()

# Load your 3D data
data = load_3D_data("path/to/your/data")

# Compress the data
compressed_data = compressor.compress(data)

# Use the compressed data in your application
render_3D(compressed_data)
```

For more detailed examples and advanced usage, please refer to the documentation.
